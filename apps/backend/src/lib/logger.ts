/**
 * Shared pino logger instance (#23).
 *
 * Import this wherever you need structured logging outside of the HTTP
 * request lifecycle. For per-request logging (with request-id correlation)
 * use the requestLogger middleware which attaches `req.log` automatically.
 *
 * In development the transport is pino-pretty for human-readable output.
 * In production/test it emits raw JSON, suitable for log aggregators.
 *
 * Correlation (#425): every log line automatically includes the current
 * request correlation ID when running within a request context. The ID is
 * read from the AsyncLocalStorage store established by requestLogger.ts, so
 * services that log outside the HTTP lifecycle (e.g. refunds.ts, dispute
 * resolution, Hasura status updates, changelog) still emit the same
 * correlation ID as the originating request.
