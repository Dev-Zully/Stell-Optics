/**
 * Anonymize the user's row in `users` and soft-delete related records.
 *
 * This mirrors the pattern in sync-user.ts: the backend holds the
 * admin-secret and performs the Hasura write server-side so the secret
 * is never exposed to the browser.
 *
 * What this does:
 *   1. Verifies the caller's Firebase ID token.
 *   2. Looks up the Hasura user row by email.
 *   3. Anonymizes PII columns (email, first_name, last_name, phone_number,
 *      profile_image_url, summary, location) and marks the row deleted.
 *   4. Deletes the Firebase Auth account so the user cannot sign back in.
 *
 * ## Cascade deletion / data-retention policy (closes #394)
 *
 * When a user requests deletion, the following deliberate policy applies to
 * each category of related data.  Every decision is intentional and must be
 * kept in sync with any future schema changes.
 *
 * ### users row
 *   ANONYMIZED — PII columns (email, first_name, last_name, phone_number,
 *   profile_image_url, summary, location, country_code) are set to NULL and
 *   `deleted_at` is stamped.  The row itself is retained (soft-delete) so
 *   that foreign-key references from escrows, listings, and reviews remain
 *   valid.  The orphaned row carries no identifying information after
 *   anonymization.
 *
 * ### ticket_listings
 *   RETAINED + ANONYMIZED BY CASCADE — listings are kept for market-history
 *   and dispute-audit purposes.  Their `seller_id` foreign key still points
 *   to the now-anonymized users row, so the listing record is automatically
 *   detached from identifying information.  No separate mutation is required;
 *   the anonymization of the users row is sufficient.
 *
 *   If a listing is in an active state (e.g., `listed`, `pending_sale`) at
 *   deletion time, any in-flight escrow for that listing must be resolved
 *   before or after deletion — Hasura row-level security prevents a deleted
 *   user from creating new listings but does not force-cancel active ones.
 *   A future improvement (#TBD) should add a `cancel_active_listings_on_delete`
 *   Hasura event trigger to handle this automatically.
 *
 * ### escrows (ticket_escrow_transactions)
 *   RETAINED for auditability / legal compliance — on-chain transactions are
 *   immutable by nature.  The backend never deletes escrow records; they are
 *   retained indefinitely with `buyer_id`/`seller_id` still pointing to the
 *   anonymized users row.  Staff/support dashboards must not display the
 *   deleted user's PII (already gone) to other parties.
 *
 * ### reviews (reviews table)
 *   RETAINED (content) + ANONYMIZED (reviewer identity) BY CASCADE — the
 *   review text, rating, and timestamp are kept so the reviewed party's
 *   reputation score remains meaningful.  `reviewer_id` is a foreign key to
 *   the users row; once that row is anonymized, queries that JOIN on it will
 *   find NULL for all PII columns, effectively surfacing "Anonymous" in the
 *   UI.  No separate mutation is required.
 *
 *   Reviews left *about* the deleted user (where `reviewee_id` = deleted user)
 *   are similarly retained: they contribute to the historical record and
 *   become associated with the now-anonymous reviewee row.
 *
 * ### ratings
 *   Same policy as reviews — retained for historical integrity, anonymized
 *   by cascade through the users foreign key.
 *
 * ### notifications
 *   NOT retained — notifications are user-facing and have no audit value
 *   after account deletion.  A `DELETE FROM notifications WHERE user_id = ?`
 *   should be added as a future improvement (#TBD) so stale notification rows
 *   are cleaned up.  Today they remain orphaned but inaccessible (the Firebase
 *   Auth account is gone so no client can authenticate to read them).
 *
 * ### Firebase Auth account
 *   HARD DELETED — `firebaseAuth.deleteUser(uid)` is called last.  If this
 *   fails after Hasura anonymization succeeds, the inconsistency is logged
 *   loudly for manual cleanup.  The PII is already gone from Hasura at that
 *   point, so the risk is limited to a zombie Firebase entry with no
 *   linked data.
