## ✅ Verify Before Closing

> **Required** — see [CONTRIBUTING.md § Verify before closing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full rationale.

Before submitting this PR for merge, confirm that the acceptance criteria of every
linked issue still pass against **this branch** (not just against your diff):

- [ ] I re-ran the specific grep / test / repro step from each linked issue's
      "Acceptance Criteria" against the current branch and it passes.
- [ ] If any linked issue contains a `verify:` fenced block, I ran that exact
      command locally and it produced the expected result.
- [ ] If I could not run a verification step (missing secrets, infra, etc.),
      I have noted this below and asked a maintainer to verify.

**Verification notes** *(leave blank if all checks passed without caveats)*:

<!-- Paste the command you ran and its output here, or explain why a step was skipped. -->

## ✅ Pre-merge Checklist

- [ ] My branch is up to date with `main` and there are no unresolved conflicts.
- [ ] I have run the relevant workspace checks (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`) locally and they pass.
- [ ] I have filled in the Summary of Changes and linked the related issue above.

### 🗄️ Database Migration Check

> Complete this section if your PR adds or modifies any file under
> `apps/backend/src/db/migrations/`. Skip it (strike through or delete) if
> your PR does not touch migrations.

- [ ] **This PR does NOT touch any migration files.** _(skip the items below)_

  — OR —

- [ ] I checked that my new migration file's number (prefix) does not collide
      with any existing migration file in `apps/backend/src/db/migrations/`.
      _(List every file in the directory, sort them, and confirm your number
      comes after the current highest one — do not rely on your local branch
      view, which may be behind `main`.)_
- [ ] I verified the sequence is correct by running the migration runner
      locally against a clean database: `yarn workspace @truestub/backend migrate:up`.
- [ ] I have not renumbered or renamed any previously-merged migration file.
      _(Renaming applied migrations breaks the runner for everyone.)_
